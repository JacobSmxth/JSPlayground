Welcome to this collection of small JavaScript projects! This repository contains four simple web applications built to practice core JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, and basic web development techniques. Each project is functional but uses minimal CSS, so don't expect anything fancy in terms of design—focus is on the JavaScript logic and functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Navigate to the desired project folder (e.g., random-quote-generator/).
4. Open the index.html file in a browser to see it in action.

> Note: Some projects (like Random Quote Generator and AI Image Search) rely on external APIs. Ensure you have an internet connection and, if required, replace placeholder API keys with your own.

## Styling Disclaimer

These projects prioritize functionality over aesthetics. The CSS is intentionally minimal—basic layouts and no polish. Feel free to enhance the styling as a fun exercise!

## Purpose

This repository is a learning playground for:

- Core JavaScript skills (async operations, event handling, etc.).
- Interacting with the DOM dynamically.
- Working with APIs and local storage.
